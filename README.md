This is my second react Project, a trivia app, I made this project 2 weeks after I started using react, You can see the code here is much cleaner an organized,
the sizes are not realative but the functionality is working great!
I stoped using class components here and started working only with function components, 
I used context here, this is also the first time i used third party npm libraries, with a simple count-down clock libary!
